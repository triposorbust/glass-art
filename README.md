### Processing sketch that makes radial Chihuly-like structures

Examples:

![example1](screenshot/ScreenShot1.png)

![example2](screenshot/ScreenShot2.png)

When running the sketch controls are:
 - `<enter>`: clear screen and spawn anew
 - `<space>`: pause spawn sequence

N.B. At least in Mac OSX there is a bug in here that I haven't fixed related to window resizing...
